<h2>ChitChat</h2>
<p>ChitChat is a simple chat application that helps you connect with other people around the world.</p> 
<p>In today's age of persistent tracking cookies, identity classification, and mass surveillance it can be difficult to exchange or view information anonymously. ChitChat has been designed as an open-source project keeping your security and privacy in mind. It enables users to chat without having to worry about nefarious third parties analyzing their behavior for commercial reasons, or personal information being leaked after servers get compromised.</p>

<h4>Talk to like-minded (or completely random) people! </h4>
<p> Search and select a chat room to join without any lengthy sign-up forms that ask for your personal information.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<h4>Create your own chat rooms!</h4>
<p>Can't find your own chat room? Just create your own! Enhance and tailor chat rooms to your needs by setting passwords, hiding them, or making them completely open for everyone.</p>

<h4>(Coming soon) Encrypt messages!</h4>
<p>On top of TLS encrpytion, private and secret chat rooms will allow users to securely transmit data through end-to-end encrption. As a result, only the people communicating can read the messages and no other person. Not even Internet service providers, myself, the server, the infrastructure hosting the server, the government, or anyone else.</p>
